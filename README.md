# Email_Sender
Send emails to an arbitrary number of people with limitless personalization. 

The program reads the first information from a notepad located in the same folder.

From it the information is taken:
- the email that will send the message
- the subject of the message
- the .txt file with the text base
- the .xlsx file with the information needed to send each email

It is possible to modify the text in several ways:

- to put in bold just put the word (or phrase) between '_' and '#' (eg _bright #)
- to italicize '_' and '$' (e.g. _calal $)
- to underline '_' and '%' (e.g., underscore%

- to insert a value of the .xlsx file, put the column name between '_' and '@'
